# Comparing-BaltimoreCity-Harlem/Surrounding NY Area-Incarceration Rates and Income (Low Parent Income), Job Growth

## Background 

In many ways, Harlem has been compared to Baltimore, at least in [popular media](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/05/03/us/a-portrait-of-the-sandtown-neighborhood-in-baltimore.html). From population flight, to stagnant job growth, to crime, drug activity, Harlem was once a true reflection of Baltimore's current plight. 

Times have changed, however, and Harlem has experienced, and is still experiencing, a revolution (in a good way). Rental prices are rising, businesses are setting up shop in the Harlem area, crime has gone down, and incarcerations + criminal/drug activity, although still an issue, are no longer Harlem's most devastating concerns. 

Baltimore, on the other hand, once a pinnacle of cultural richness, is experiencing a revolution in the opposite direction: Criminal + drug activity is set free and allowed to roam and businesses and individuals are moving out of Baltimore. 

To investigate some of the differences between Baltimore and Harlem, I took a look at [OpportunityAtlas](https://www.opportunityatlas.org/) group has produced to analyze some of the differences in Harlem and Baltimore's populations, at least among the individuals who came from the lowest percentile of parent income.
