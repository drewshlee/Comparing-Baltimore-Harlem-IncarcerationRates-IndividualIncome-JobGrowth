# Comparing-BaltimoreCity-Harlem/Surrounding NY Area-Incarceration Rates and Income (Low Parent Income), Job Growth

## Background 

In many ways, Harlem has been compared to Baltimore, at least in [popular media](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/05/03/us/a-portrait-of-the-sandtown-neighborhood-in-baltimore.html). From population flight, to stagnant job growth, to crime, drug activity, Harlem was once a true reflection of Baltimore's current plight. Times have changed, however, and Harlem has experienced a revolution for the better (more jobs, population growth, etc.).


Baltimore, on the other hand, once a pinnacle of cultural richness, is experiencing a revolution in the opposite direction: Criminal + drug activity is set free and allowed to roam and businesses and individuals are moving out of Baltimore. 

To investigate some of the differences between Baltimore and Harlem, I took a look at [OpportunityAtlas](https://www.opportunityatlas.org/) group has produced to analyze some of the differences in Harlem and Baltimore's populations, at least among the individuals who came from the lowest percentile of parent income.

## Analysis

I will analyze: 
 - General Job growth in the U.S. from 2004 to 2013
- Any relationships/correlation between Incarceration Rate and Individual Income in individuals who had a low income parent
- Relationships between individual job growth, income, and incarceration rates in Baltimore and Harlem/Surrounding NY


## Analysis Results

- For individuals from low parent income households, incarceration rates and individual income don't show a clear correlation. However, there is somewhat of a correlation between income and incarceration rates: Relatively high individual incomes (>40k or so) match with low incarceration rates.

- Taking a closer look into Baltimore, specifically, shows a more clear cut relation between low income and incarceration rates. 

- Harlem and its surrounding area also shows somewhat of a correlation: When income decreases, incarceration rates increase.

- In Harlem and surrounding NYC areas, we can see job growth (2004-2013), but there are a good chunk of areas in Baltimore that show a decline in job growth from 2004-2013. A lack of job growth, coupled with low income are likely to play a role in Baltimore's incarceration rates.
